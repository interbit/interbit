## To get started, make a new Interbit site

### Get the source code
1. Fork the Interbit repository
1. Clone the forked repository on your PC

### Make a new Interbit site by creating a new package
Let's call the new site `app-the-new-thing`

1. Copy the `packages/template` folder to `packages/app-the-new-thing`

### Make the following changes in `packages/app-the-new-thing`:

1. `.package.json` Change the name
   ```
   {
     "name": "app-the-new-thing",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     ...
   }
   ```

1. Tweak `src/App.js` so that you can identify your site

## Install the dependencies
Run `npm i` from the repository root.  This will take care of all the lerna dependencies and set up for you

## Build the new Interbit site
1. From within the `packages/app-the-new-thing` folder, run `npm run start:interbit`.  This command will keep running until interrupted.  Let it continue to run.
1. Open a second shell.  From within the `packages/app-the-new-thing` folder, run `npm run start`.  This runs the development server and will cause a browser window to open to http://localhost:3000 You should see your site load in the browser.

The development server continues to run.  Changes made to the Interbit website will be automatically reflected in the browser.
