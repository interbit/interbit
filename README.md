# Interbit Platform Repository

Interbit is a blockchain platform for building enterprise-grade applications. Interbitâ€™s proprietary blockchain technology makes application development better and faster. All of the trust and reliability of blockchain technology with much less work and maintenance.

The Interbit Platform is a set of services and tools built on and for Interbit. 

Disclaimer

The Interbit Platform is currently a test environment provided for information, education, and evaluation purposes. There is no guarantee of data preservation, uptime, stability, or security - the environment is provided "as is" with no express or implied warranty.

We will be updating this environment regularly - adding functionality, applications, and addressing issues. Our Slack community is open for reporting issues, feedback, and announcements of updates to the platform.

### To get started:

```
npm i
```

This will take care of all the lerna dependencies and set up for you

## To make a new site

1. Copy the `packages/template` folder to `packages/app-the-new-thing`

## Make the following changes in `packages/app-the-new-thing`:

1. `.env` Change the APP_NAME
```
APP_NAME=app-the-new-thing
```

2. `.package.json` Change the name
```
{
  "name": "app-the-new-thing",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  ...
}
```

3. Tweak `src/App.js` so that you can identify your site


## Then to develop locally:

```
$ cd packages/app-the-new-thing
$ npm start
```

If you would like to run the sites involved in MVP development (app-account, app-project, template & redux-proxy-server)

```
$ npm run start:dev # from the root
```

If you have changed lib-react-interbit and would like to include your changes in your app...

```
$ cd packages/lib-react-interbit
$ npm run build
$ cd ../app-to-work-on
$ npm start
```

If you want to work on the common components in lib-react-interbit there is a demo app that can be launched with `npm start`. The source for the demo app is in `packages/lib-react-interbit/demo/src`

This system currently deploys to a heroku pipeline.

CI tests all commits before auto deploying to the `development` stage of the pipeline.

Deployment events can be viewed and controlled from slack in the #machines channel: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/chatops


## To change the Template.

There is a node script inside of utils/src/distributeTemplate.js that will distribute some of the changes made to the template files to all packages that match the pattern `/app-*/`

It will clobber the following files in each app with the template versions:
 - anything in src that is a js or svg file
 - anything in the public dir
 - redux/chainReducer.js
 - services/blockchain.js

 Except for:
  - src/App.js
  - src/exports.js
  - public/manifest.json

To anything matching `/app-*/` and the template itself it will:
  - force standardized proxying
  - force standardized scripts
  - ensure the following dependencies are met

```json
{
  "interbit": "1.0.0",
  "interbit-covenant-utils": "1.0.0",
  "interbit": "1.0.0",
  "lib-react-interbit": "1.0.0",
  "react": "^16.2.0",
  "react-bootstrap": "0.31.5",
  "react-redux": "5.0.6",
  "react-scripts": "1.0.17",
  "redux": "3.7.2",
  "seamless-immutable": "^7.1.2"
}
```


*If you need to make any changes to these standardized files think very carefully about doing so before propagating them out to all the app packages.*

### To Distribute Template Changes

Commit your intended changes and work with a clean git status... this will make resetting your changes much easier if you break something.

```
$ cd packages/utils
$ npm run distribute:template
$ npm t                             # test your changes
$ npm run start:dev                 # Poke around and make sure you didn't break anything
$ git add .
$ git commit -m"Distribute changes to..."
```
