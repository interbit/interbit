# Glossary

## ACL

Access Control List. This list indicates who is permitted to do what on any given blockchain.

## Action Creator
Action creators are precisely named - they are functions that create Actions.

See [Redux Basics - Action Creators](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html#action-creators)

## Action
Actions are payloads of information that send data. They are the only source of information. Actions are sent to the blockchain via `.dispatch()` where they are interpreted by a Smart Contract.

See Key Concept entry for [Actions](key-concepts/README.md#actions).

See [Redux FAQ - Actions](http://redux.js.org/docs/faq/Actions.html)

## Application
Every distinct application built on the Interbit platform. The platform itself comprises many of these, but this also includes apps.

## Application State
The application state is the state resulting from all of the actions in the blockchain being passed through the smart contracts, from the initial state and [genesis block](GLOSSARY.html#genesis-block) up to the latest block.

See Key Concept entry for [Application State](key-concepts/README.md#application-state).

See [Redux Glossary - State](http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html#state)

## Block
A block is a sequential set of actions that are grouped together, and then linked by cryptographic hash to the preceding blocks on a chain.

Within Interbit, each block may be comprised of these pieces:
* Actions - one or more actions
* Application State Hash
* Previous Block’s Hash

## Blockchain

A blockchain is a distributed system whose transactions ([actions](key-concepts/README.md#actions)) securely link to each other to provide an immutable history and a single state across nodes resulting from those transactions.

The application state of the blockchain is assembled throughout operation as the nodes validate blocks of actions, and the resulting state changes, and then adds those blocks to the chain.

## Blockchain State
At a minimum, the Blockchain State includes the headers of the blocks back to the [genesis block](GLOSSARY.html#genesis-block). Each block contains a list of actions, in order, that occurred during that block.

The Blockchain State also includes the immutable memory of every change since its beginning. This is achieved by having all of the block headers back to the [genesis block](GLOSSARY.html#genesis-block).

Each time the state changes, a reference is made to the blockheight at which it last changed along with the current blockheight. This allows for searching the blockchain history to determine when changes were made.

In each block, only the data that has changed from the previous block — the difference, or “diff” — is stored, minimizing storage and increasing performance.

## Blockheight
A block is assigned a blockheight based on its order in the chain, counting from the first block (the [genesis block](GLOSSARY.html#genesis-block)).

## Consensus
Consensus in computing is reaching agreement on data across a distributed, decentralized system. In the blockchain space, consensus is how your nodes come to agreement on a particular block so that it can be added to the blockchain.

There are a few different approaches to achieving consensus in blockchains. Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Authority are the most common. Without going into definitions and descriptions of each, know that there are limitations to each type. Interbit uses an algorithm to provide Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus, which is reliable against both benign and malicious faults on up to (n/3)-1 nodes where n=the number of nodes.

## Core (Interbit Core)
The library/package that delivers blockchain virtual machine functionality.

## Covenant
A Covenant is a combination of Initial State and a Smart Contract (Redux Reducer), as well as the reducer's corresponding Action Creators, and Sagas. It is a way to encapsulate all facets of a specific area of business logic. A covenant is essentially an npm package.

## Cryptography
Interbit uses encryption for secure digital signatures and encryption of data.

## Dispatch
The act of sending an Action to a Reducer. Dispatching an Action is the only way to change the state of a chain.

## Ecosystem
The network of applications built on Interbit, AND the community of developers and companies.

## Genesis Block
The first block on a blockchain, typically providing configuration information and initial state.

## Guest Chain
A customer-facing application chain. It is hosted on the Host Chain, similar to how a guest operating system is run on a virtual machine host. A guest chain runs on a host chain.

## Hashing
Hashing is the transformation of data into a fingerprint value that represents the original data.

Every Block in turn has its data (Actions, State difference hash, and the previous Block's hash) hashed and used to contribute to the immutable and retraceable Blockchain.

## Host Chain
An internal chain used to power Interbit. It hosts a guest chain similarly to how virtual machines run on a host operating system.

## Hypervisor
The small piece of code that boots the Host Chain. This does all the prep work to start up the Host Chain which then continues to do the heavy lifting of application processing, blocking, signing, networking, hashing, etc. This models how virtual machine hosts work. First, they boot the hypervisor, then a host OS boots, then the guests boot.

## Node
An instance of a Host Chain running on a server, virtual machine, docker container, or similar.

Note: Do not equate a node with a server. Watch for confusion with Node.js.

## Platform (Interbit Platform)
The set of applications that comprise a place for developers to go to build applications as well as apps/services that makes building apps easier. (e.g. account app, payment processor app, marketplace app, etc.).

## Reducer
Reducers determine how the application's state changes in response to actions.

## Saga
Side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) in React/Redux applications. A saga is like a separate thread in your application that is solely responsible for side effects.

## Security model

All stored data is encrypted with Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256)

Digital signing is used.

## Smart Contract
Smart Contracts are code that will facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.

In the context of a generalized blockchain smart contract, it is most easily understood as the relevant business logic for a particular event (action) in the application.

Interbit's Smart Contracts are implemented as Redux Reducers.

See Key Concept entry for [Smart Contracts](key-concepts/README.md#smart-contracts).

## Smart Contracts

See [Smart Contract](#smart-contract).

## Storage
Storage

## Strobe
Strobes occur frequency and provide a juncture for Smart Contracts to be executed. This is especially important for applications that are not driven by user interaction, but by interaction with external applications.
