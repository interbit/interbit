# Using the Template Application

This walk-through starts where the [Getting
Started](../getting-started/README.md) guide left off.

The template application may seem like a lot but it comes with an
architecture that allows each browser to interact with the application
using its own private chain, and shows the user how to join two chains
together through redirects.

In this walk-through we will cover:

  - [Version requirements](./template.md#version-requirements)
  - [Application structure](./template.md#application-structure)
    - Directory structure
    - Chain architecture
  - [Sponsored Chains](./template.md#sponsored-chains)
  - [The Interbit Config](./template.md#the-interbit-config)
    - Static chains
    - Covenants
    - Joins
    - Apps
  - [The Covenants](./template.md#the-covenants)
    - The Private Covenant
    - The Public Covenant
    - The Control Covenant
  - [The Application](./template.md#the-application)
    - index.js
    - Connecting the Chain to a UI Component

## Version Requirements

To develop Interbit applications, your development environment will need
the following software:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 8.6 or higher
* [NPM](https://nodejs.org/) 5.8 or higher


## Application Structure

This template comes with a lot of moving parts to help you bootstrap an
application that uses joined chains from the browser.

Below we cover the files and folders in the app and what they are used
for. We will exclude `.env`, `.gitignore`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
`package.json`, and `README.md`.

When you run an Interbit node, it generates a data store called
`db-interbit`.

When you run the `interbit:build` command, it generates a `dist/`
directory containing the Interbit build.

When you run the `build` command, it generates a `build/` directory
containing the React app build.


### Chain Architecture

In this application there are 3 types of chains.

- A public chain which is loaded by everyone in the browser

- A private chain that is created for each browser that connects to the
  public chain and belongs to the user

- A control chain which resides only on the nodes and is responsible for
  hosting and authorizing the private chains

The chain type is defined by its covenant.

Because this is a permissioned system, simply loading a chain in the
browser is not enough to interact with it. The browser is running a full
node with its own set of keys and those keys must be authorized to
interact with the system somehow.

We use a process called chain sponsorship to perform this authorization.

</div>


## Sponsored Chains

A sponsored chain can request for a host to run the sponsored chain on
the host's hypervisor. The host can deny this request.

The sponsored chain is the one that being run on another hypervisor, and
the host is the one running the sponsored chain.

Being a sponsored chain means that some other hypervisor has agreed to
run your genesis block (and therefore your chain) outside of the
hypervisor it was created on. This means that the private chains, once
sponsored, can persist and be propagated throughout the network but only
if they meet a certain criteria and the host, the control chain in our
case, is willing to host them.

Sponsoring is important, because without it our private chains would not
be able to run outside of the browser window that opened them. They need
to be hosted outside of the browser so that when a user clears the
browser's local storage or loads the application from a separate device,
they can get their own chain back.

In order to be sponsored a chain must:

1. Run a specific covenant on it. The covenant hash and therefore the
   code must be known to the host.

1. Allow the hosting chain to form all of its blocks by including it's
   public key as root and as the block master.

1. Know the chain ID of its host and send the host its sponsorship
   request.

It is not important to know how sponsorship works immediately, but it is
worth understanding in more detail if you want to know everything about
how the application works.

## The Interbit Config

The Interbit config determines how your node will run. The configuration
in the template application specifies two static chains, three
covenants, one application, and one peer.

<div class="tips info">
  <p><span></span>Updating the Config</p>
  <p>
    When you update the config you will need to restart the Interbit
    node using <code>npm run interbit:start</code>.
  </p>
</div>


### Configured Static Chains

The static chains configured for our application are the public and
control chains.

The public chain is loaded in the browser and on the node and supplies
the browser with the instructions necessary to create a sponsorable
private chain.

The control chain is only loaded on the node and is responsible for
hosting and controlling the private chains.

This example does not demonstrate creation of dynamic chains.

 - [Interbit Configuration File](../reference/interbit-cli/config.md)
 - [Static and Dynamic Chains](./static-dynamic.md)


### Configured Covenants

There are three covenants used in this application.

The [public
covenant](https://github.com/interbit/interbit/tree/master/packages/template/src/interbit/public)
is an identity reducer. Much like an identity function, it always
returns its state. Because anyone can load it in the browser it supports
no actions at all.

The [control
covenant](https://github.com/interbit/interbit/tree/master/packages/template/src/interbit/control)
does not do much either, as the functionality required to sponsor chains
comes with [`interbit-core`](../reference/interbit-core/README.md). When
this chain is initially deployed and receives a SET_MANIFEST action,
which contains covenant hashes and chain IDs for the network, it sets up
information about how it would like sponsored chains to apply for
sponsorship. This is shared with the public chain via read join in the
[Interbit configuration](./template.md#configured-joins).

The [private
covenant](https://github.com/interbit/interbit/tree/master/packages/template/src/interbit/private)
describes how the users interact with the application. They allow the
users to add memos that only they can see as well as sum numbers
together.

 - [Writing Covenants](./covenants.md)


### Configured Joins

There are two joins configured for the template app. Both joins are a
read join from the control chain to the public chain.

The first join is named `'INTERBIT_SERVICES'` and contains URLs to link
to interbit services such as `accounts.test-interbit.io`.

The second join is named `'HOSTING_SPONSOR'` and it contains the
information required for a private chain to be sponsored. This includes:

- the control chain's chain ID
- the control chain's public key
- a hash of the covenant that the control chain is willing to host.

This is all the information a private chain needs to be hosted. This
information is given to the public chain so that it is available in the
browser. This information will be provided by the browser's hypervisor
to the host so that the private chain can be sponsored.

 - [What is a Join](../key-concepts/README.md#chain-joining)
 - [How to Join](./joining.md)


### Configured Apps

This Interbit configuration file specifies configuration for one
application. The configuration specifies an `index.html` file to update
with peers and chain IDs that the middleware will load.

Every time you generate a new chain ID by running a new Interbit node,
the index.html file specified in `apps` will update with any new
information.

```js
  apps: {
    theNewThing: {
      peers: ['localhost:5000'], // the peers the browser should connect to
      chains: [chainAliases.PUBLIC], // the chains that need to load in the browser
      indexLocation: path.join(__dirname, 'public/index.html'), // the index.html to update with the app info
      // ...
    }
  }
```

Further Reading
- [Apps Config](../reference/interbit-cli/config.md#apps)


## The Covenants

The `src/interbit` folder contains the covenants that will run on the
Interbit blockchains.

Each covenant must be written as though it were an npm package about to
be published to npm. This means that it can contain no file references
outside of its folder, even though it is inside of another project. This
is because when it is loaded onto the chain for distribution throughout
the blockchain network, it will not have access to the rest of the files
in the project.

It is also important that each covenant be an npm package with its own
`package.json` file, specifying its dependencies. These covenants should
use immutable state from the
[`seamless-immutable`](https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable)
npm package.

<div class="tips info">
  <p><span></span>Changing the Covenants</p>
  <p>
    When you change the covenants you will need to turn the Interbit
    node off and on again.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is an open issue to restore the covenant watch and deploy
    feature. (#181)
  </p>
</div>


### The Private Covenant

The private covenant is the one the browser's hypervisor will be
authorized to use. This means that it is the one the user will interact
with the most.

Because of this, it contains two (not very) interesting actions
`ADD_MEMO` and `ADD_NUMBER`. Actions for this covenant are dispatched to
the private chain from the React app's UI.

The covenant's reducer, which updates application state, is written the
same way as a redux reducer.

Here is the `ADD_MEMO` action in the private covenant's reducer:

```js
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  // ...
  switch (action.type) {
    case actionTypes.MEMO: {
      const { text } = action.payload
      const memos = state.getIn(['memos'], Immutable.from([]))

      return text ? state.set('memos', memos.concat(text)) : state
    }

    // ...

    default:
      return state
  }
}
```


### The Public Covenant

The public covenant acts as a buffer between the control covenant and
the outside world. It is loaded in the browser as dictated in the
Interbit config file.

It simply provides the information required for the browser's hypervisor
to send a sponsorship request to the control chain.


### The Control Covenant

The control chain only sets up information about sponsorship and shares
it with the public chain.


## The Application

The React application for this project was created using
[`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/).

The React application syncs to the blockchain and makes the sponsorship
request using the `interbit-middleware` from the `interbit-ui-tools`
package. The middleware knows which peers to connect to and which chains
to load from the information written by config to the `index.html` file.

The `index.js` file that loads the React app also attaches the
middleware and prepares it for sponsorship.


### `index.js`

Let's take a look at `src/index.js`.

```jsx
// ... imports occur

const interbitMiddleware = createInterbitMiddleware({
  publicChainAlias: PUBLIC,
  privateChainAlias: PRIVATE
})

const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware()

const store = createStore(
  reducers,
  composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(interbitMiddleware, sagaMiddleware))
)
sagaMiddleware.run(interbitSaga)

// BlockExplorer will monitor the public chain
store.dispatch(setSelectedChain(PRIVATE))

// eslint-disable-next-line react/no-render-return-value
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)

registerServiceWorker()
```

It's a fairly straightforward file with only a few steps

1. The middleware is attached to the redux store as a middleware.
1. Saga middleware is added to the store.
1. We include redux devtools because they are lovely.
1. The interbit middleware saga is run.
1. We dispatch an action into the redux store to tell it which chain we
   want to see first.
1. The react app is rendered.
1. The service worker from create-react-app is rendered.

The middleware is loaded with sponsorship details by giving the chain
aliases of the public and private chain. When the middleware loads, it
will automatically generate a new private chain with details from the
public chain. This private chain will be attached to the redux store and
automatically synced every time a block is formed by the middleware.

### Connecting the Chain to a UI Component

The React component `InteractiveChains`, found at
`app-the-new-thing/src/containers/InteractiveChains.js`, does a few
things to map the blockchain dispatch to the UI.

First, it is a redux connected component which has mapped the Interbit
middleware state to props and has also mapped a special redux action
from the middleware to props.

Mapping state to props is simple since the middleware handles almost
everything for you. Inside of state.interbit lies all the state from the
chains that were connected to the app from the apps configuration in the
Interbit config file.

The dispatch is a little more interesting. Let's take a look:

```jsx
import { chainDispatch } from 'interbit-ui-tools'
// ...
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  resetForm: form => {
    dispatch(reset(form))
  },
  // We have curried this function by chain alias, so that we can dispatch to the blockchain through the middleware
  blockchainDispatch: chainAlias => action =>
    dispatch(chainDispatch(chainAlias, action))
})
// ...

export class InteractiveChains extends Component {
  // ...

  render() {
    const { selectedChain, resetForm, blockchainDispatch } = this.props
    // ...

    return (
      <Grid>
        <Row>
          <LinkedCovenant
            // ...

            // Here we are using the blockchainDispatch like any other redux dispatch prop
            blockchainDispatch={blockchainDispatch(selectedChain.chainAlias)}
          />
        </Row>
      </Grid>
    )
  }
}
```

First, in mapDispatchToProps there is a prop called `blockchainDispatch`
which dispatches a chainDispatch action from `interbit-ui-tools` to the
redux store. This function takes an action that is destined for your
blockchain and the alias of the blockchain to send it to.

In our case, when we pass the prop to `LinkedCovenant` in the render
function we are currying it to use the chain that is selected in our
redux state. This way, whenever a new chain is loaded in the UI we are
automatically mapping our dispatch to the chain that was selected.

When this action is dispatched to the redux store the middleware will
intercept it and send it to the correct blockchain. The middleware will
return the promise that was returned from the blockchain from the redux
dispatch function. This promise will resolve when the action is accepted
by the chain.

## Conclusion

The template application utilizes the PPC model to authorize a chain to
run in the browser and interact with the application chains. This model
can be extended into many other architectures that use a private user
chain in the browser to interact with one or many chains in different
contexts.

This application also leverages the interbit middleware to sync the
blockchain with the redux store, so the UI developer doesn't have to
interact directly with the chain, but instead can use the redux store.
