# Interbit CLI

Interbit provides scripts that work with an app that is either created
with create-interbit-app (coming soon...) or installed to a project with
npm. It aids in developing and deploying Interbit applications.

It is composed of two packages, `interbit` and `interbit-cli` which
wraps the interbit package to provide a command line interface (CLI) to
work with Interbit.


## Interbit CLI

The CLI provides some basic functionality for managing the chain
application lifecycle from development mode to production. It allows you
to configure your network, build a manifest describing an Interbit
blockchain network, and deploy your network from a single configuration
file and interface.

It offers three main commands as well as several helper commands to make
things easier.

 - [start](start.md)
 - [build](build.md)
 - [deploy](deploy.md)
 - [create](create.md)

There are two important files used to manage the chain application lifecycle

 - [Configuration](config.md)
 - [Manifest](manifest.md)
