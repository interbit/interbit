# `build`

Builds an Interbit application from a [configuration](config.md) file.

This script:

- generates a [manifest](manifest.md) file based on the provided
  [configuration](config.md)

- packs all covenants described in the configuration and outputs them to
  `dist/covenants`

- updates the `index.html` files described in [configuration](config.md)
  with the chain IDs that were resolved in the [manifest](manifest.md)

Coming soon:

- build your front end applications by executing the build steps
  provided

- update only the index.html file from the completed application build

- support an interbit root node and [cascading
  deployment](../../chain-management/cascading-deployment.md)


## Options

1. `--config` *(Filepath)*: a filepath to a config file

1. `--artifacts` *(Filepath)*: a filepath to output built artifacts to

1. `--manifest` *(Filepath)*: a filepath to a pre-existing manifest used
   for initial variable resolution


## Example

```bash
interbit build --config [configFilePath] --manifest [manifestFilePath] --artifacts [outputDir]
```
