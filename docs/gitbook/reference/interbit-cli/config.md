# The Interbit Configuration File

The interbit configuration file containts instructions for the [build](build.md) script. It details how to read and bundle your covenants and deploy them to a network. The build script will consume a configuration and file and resolve the variables inside of it to generate a manifest file used to deploy your network.

It is a JS file and can be altered at any time.

It contains network information such as peers, validator public keys, and the different chains your network may run. It also contains a list of [covenants](../../key-concepts/README.md#covenants) and which blockchains they will run on.

## Example

Your interbit.config.js file would look something like this:

```js
const path = require('path')

const config = {
  peers: ['localhost:5000', 'localhost:5050'], // First peers to connect to
  adminValidators: [process.env.ADMIN_KEY_1, process.env.ADMIN_KEY_2], // Deployment pubkeys for the root node
  staticChains: { // Chain configuration
    hub: {
      covenant: 'hub',
      childChains: ['spoke1']
      config: {
        // The first validator listed is the blockMaster
        validators: [process.env.PUBKEY_1, process.env.PUBKEY_2],
        joins: {
          consume: [],
          provide: [],
          receiveActionFrom: [
            {
              alias: 'spoke',
              authorizedActions: ['DO_A_THING']
            }
          ],
          sendActionTo: [{ alias: 'spoke1' }]
        }
      },
    },
    spoke1: {
      covenant: 'spoke',
      parentChain: 'hub',
      config: {
        validators: [process.env.PUBKEY_3, process.env.PUBKEY_4, process.env.PUBKEY_5],
        joins: {
          consume: [],
          provide: [],
          receiveActionFrom: [
            {
              alias: 'hub',
              authorizedActions: ['DO_A_THING']
            }
          ],
          sendActionTo: [{ alias: 'hub' }]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  covenants: {
    hub: {
      location: path.join(__dirname, 'hub')
    },
    spoke: {
      location: path.join(__dirname, 'spoke')
    }
  },
  // Which index.html files to upgrade with chain information during start/build/deploy
  // One molecule may have several websites that it serves
  apps: {
    example: {
      peers: [], // the peers the browser should connect to
      chains: ['hub', 'spoke1'], // the chains that need to load in the browser
      indexLocation: path.join(__dirname, 'public/index.html'), // the index.html to update with the app info
    }
  }
}

module.exports = config
```

## Peers

```js
{
  peers: ['localhost:5050', 'localhost:8888']
}
```

The peers configuration specifies the peers list that all of the nodes in your network should connect to. This peers list is specifically for nodes only.

Each peer must specify a host and a port in the format `'host:port'`

## Static Chains

```js
{
  staticChains: {
    chainA: { ..chainAConfiguration },
    chainB: { ..chainBConfiguration },
  }
}
```

The static chains configuration specifies how each chain that is configured statically (meaning they exist when the network is intially deployed and are not created at runtime, through code, dynamically) is setup.

This includes their covenants, public keys, and chain joins.

### validators

```js
{
  staticChains: {
    chainA: {
      config: {
        validators: ['pubkey1']
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The validators configuration for a static chain indicates public keys for blocking nodes. In the PoA implementation, the first pulic key is the blockmaster and forms the blocks.

### Covenant

```js
{
  staticChains: {
    chainA: {
      covenant: 'covenantAlias'
    }
  },
  covenants: {
    covenantAlias: { ...covenantConfiguration }
  }
}
```

The covenant configuration for a static chain determines which configured covenant will be applied to the chain.

The covenant is described with a string that points to a key in the [covenants](#covenants) congifuration. The covenant must be configured for the confguration to be valid.

### childChains

<div class="tips danger">
  <p><span></span>Feature Unimplemented</p>
  <p>This part of config supports an unimplemented feature.</p>
</div>

The chains that are children of this chain. Being children of this chain means that when the chain is redeployed, these chains will receive the manifest on SET_MANIFEST and forward the manifest to their children so that Interbit can apply necessary configuration changes.

Refer to [Cascading Deployment](../../chain-management/cascading-deployment.md) for more information.

### Joins

```js
{
  staticChains: {
    chainA: {
      config: {
        joins: {
          receiveActionsFrom: [{
            alias: 'chainB',
            authorizedActions: ['DO_A_THING']
          }],
          consume: [{
            alias: 'chainB',
            path: ['state', 'props', 'path'],
            joinName: 'FRIENDLY_NEIGHBOURHOOD_JOIN'
          }]
        }
      }
    },
    chainB: {
      config: {
        joins: {
          sendActionsTo: [{ alias: 'chainA' }],
          provide: [{
            alias: 'chainA',
            path: ['state', 'props', 'path'],
            joinName: 'FRIENDLY_NEIGHBOURHOOD_JOIN'
          }]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The join configuration for a pair of static chains determines whether they will be authorized to share state or dispatch actions to each other. The joins must correspond to eachother.

## Covenants

```js
{
  covenants: {
    covenantAlias: {
      location: '../filepath/package-dir'
    }
  }
}
```

The covenants configuration specifies where local covenant packages can be found for packing and deploying to your blockchains.

These covenants must be npm packable from an external location due to the distribution of covenants across the network. This means no external, local, file references.

## Apps

```js
{
  apps: {
    account: {
      peers: ['localhost'],
      chains: ['chainA'],
      indexLocation: path.join(__dirname, 'public/index.html')
    }
  }
}
```

The apps configuration contains peers that browser nodes should connect to, chains that browser applications should load, and an index.html file location to write this browser configuration to so it is available once the app is served at runtime.

When start or build are run, the configuration for each app will be writted into the corresponding index.html file on a dom element with `id="interbit"`.

If you wish to manage browser nodes yourself you may omit the apps configuration.

Peers in the apps configuration should not specify a port. The port should be selected in the app itself based on the protocol it was served over. For example, if your app is served at https://yourApp.com it should connect to localhost:443. Otherwise it should use localhost:80. The magic of the internet and dns routing will do the rest for browser nodes.

It is still possible for a browser node to connect directly to the desired port and host.
