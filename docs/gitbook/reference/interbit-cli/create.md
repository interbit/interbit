# `create`

Creates a new Interbit application with a connected React front end
application.

This application is created in a directory based on the `--name`
provided. The new application comes with scripts to interact with the
React app and the Interbit application. It is ready to go with node
modules already installed.

Simply run the node in one terminal:

```sh
npm run interbit:start
```

And then run the React app in another:

```sh
npm start
```
