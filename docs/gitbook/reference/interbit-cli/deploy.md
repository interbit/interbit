# `deploy`

Deploys an application.

Note that hosting the static index.html is a separate concern handled
elsewhere. Deploy does not deploy your front end application. It only
deploys your blockchain nodes.

`deploy` tells the local hypervisor to host the chains described in the
provided manifest file.


## Options

1. `--manifest` *(Filepath)*: an Interbit manifest file used for
   deployment instructions. If none is provided it will be read from
   `{--artifacts}/interbit.manifest.json`

1. `--artifacts` *(Filepath)*: a directory of build artifacts to deploy.
   Should contain a manifest file and packed covenants. If none is given
   the current working directory is used.

1. `--port` *(number)*: The port number interbit will communicate on

1. `--key-pair` *(filepath)*: a js or json file exporting a key pair to
   be used to boot the hypervisor with. If none is given a random pair
   will be generated which may not be permissioned on the chain network.


#### Usage

```sh
interbit deploy --manifest [interbitManifestFile] --artifacts [buildArtifactsLocation] --port 8888 --key-pair [pathToKeys]
```
