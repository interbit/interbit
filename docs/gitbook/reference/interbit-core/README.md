# Interbit Core

Following the Redux design pattern, the Interbit API has been kept to an absolute minimum footprint. This simplicity empowers the rapid and elegant development of complex applications.

To build an application powered by Interbit, first define an initial Application State, actions, and a set of Smart Contracts (essentially reducers). Then, using the API methods detailed below, orchestrate your blockchain as a Node.js application.
