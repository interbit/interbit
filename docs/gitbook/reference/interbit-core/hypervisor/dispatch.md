# `dispatch()`

Dispatches a single action to a chain. This is the only way to trigger a
state change.

This is a method that is called from a running chain.


## Arguments

1. `action` *(Object)*: an object whose data can affect a change your
   application will understand

Note: Actions are how new data is fed to the blockchain. Actions must
have a `type` field that indicates the requested action and a `payload`
field that contains context specific data. Best practice is to define
types as string constants, imported from another module.


## Returns

*(Object)*: the dispatched action.


## Example

```js
const action = {
  type: 'EVENT_OCCURRED',
  payload: {
    data: { }
  }
}

const hypervisor = interbit.createHypervisor()

hypervisor.dispatch(action)
```


## Tips

* You cannot call `dispatch` from inside a smart contract or another
  reducer.
