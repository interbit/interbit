# `destroy()`

When redispatched from within a covenant or dispatched to a chain, it
destroys this chain in the same manner as the cli method
[`destroyChain(chainId)`](../interbit-core/cli/destroyChain.md).

To destroy means removing chain related resources from all hypervisors
that host the chain except if other chains have a join with the deleted
chain. Their join config is not cleaned up automatically.

except: any chain related data in the kv store is not being deleted yet


## Arguments

None


## Returns

An action that can be dispatched to a chain to destroy it.


## Example

```js
const { destroy, redispatch } = require('interbit-covenant-utils')

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  const destroyAction = destroy()
  const nextState = redispatch(nextState, destroyAction)

  return nextState
}
```
