# `startConsumeState()`

Generates an action that can be dispatched to a chain to begin the
process of consuming state with a read join.

When dispatched, this action will allow a consumer chain to begin
consuming the provider state. The consumer will mount the state given by
the provider chain to the consumer chain application state at the mount
path specified in the action. 

This action should be dispatched to the consumer chain for a read join.

#### Arguments

1. `provider` *(string)*: The chain ID of the blockchain that will be
   providing state.

1. `mount` *(array [string])*: A state path that the shared state will
   be mounted to.

1. `joinName` *(string)*: A name for the join. This must be the same as
   the name used by the provider chain.


#### Returns

None


#### Example

```js
const covenantUtils = require('interbit-covenant-utils')
// ...
const consumeStateAction = covenantUtils.startConsumeState({provider, mount, joinName})
// ...
chainInterface.dispatch(consumeStateAction)
```
