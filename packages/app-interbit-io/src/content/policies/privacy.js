**Effective as of April 23, 2018.**

BTL Group Ltd. (“**BTL**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”) is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit BTL Websites as defined below (“**Visitors**”), individuals who register to use the Services as defined below (“**Customers**”), and individuals who register to attend BTL’s corporate events (“**Attendees**”).  This Privacy Policy describes BTL’s privacy practices in relation to the use of BTL Websites and the related applications, services, and programs offered by BTL (collectively, the “**Services**”), as well as individuals’ choices regarding use, access and correction of personal information.

1. **Websites Covered**

This Privacy Policy covers the information practices, including how BTL collects, uses, discloses, shares and secures the personal information you provide, of websites owned or controlled by BTL that display a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively referred to as “**BTL Websites**”).

BTL Websites may contain links to other, third party websites. The information practices or the content of such other websites is governed by the privacy policies of such other websites. BTL encourages you to review the privacy policies of other websites to understand their information practices.

2. **Information Collected**

You may voluntarily give BTL your information when expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services, registering to use the BTL Websites or other Services, registering for an event, corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise, or participating in bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the BTL Websites.  This information may include personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address.

As you navigate BTL Websites, BTL may also automatically collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies (“**Website Navigational Information**”). Website Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the actions you take on BTL Websites (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked).

3. **Use of Information Collected**

BTL uses information that you give us to perform the services requested, administer and build your BTL account (if you register for one), to market new services that we believe will be of interest to you where permitted by applicable law, and to provide you with the information that you request from us.  For example, if you fill out a “Contact Me” Web form, BTL will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Services.  BTL may also use your information as required or permitted by applicable law.

BTL may also use information that you give us for marketing purposes, on an opt-in basis and in accordance with Canadian regulation and/or other applicable laws. For example, BTL may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding BTL, its affiliates, and its partners, such as information about promotions or events.

BTL uses Website Navigational Information to operate and improve BTL Websites.

4. **Website Navigational Information**

*Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Addresses*

As described more fully below, we and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer BTL Websites and Services, track users’ movements around BTL Websites and Services, and gather information about our user base as a whole.  This section describes the types of Website Navigational Information used on BTL Websites and Services, and how this information may be used.

*Cookies*

BTL uses cookies to make interactions with BTL Websites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the BTL Websites, BTL’s servers send a cookie to your computer or device. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to BTL, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” form) or have previously identified yourself to BTL, you remain anonymous to BTL.

BTL uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer or device when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer or device after you close your browser or turn off your computer. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on BTL Websites or Services.

*Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data*

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer BTL Websites and Services.  This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage. Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use BTL Websites and Services, we automatically receive the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave the BTL Website. This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve BTL Websites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal information, and to provide the Websites and Services. For example, BTL uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate BTL Websites. BTL also collects IP addresses from Customers when they log into the Services as part of BTL’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.

5. **Public Forums, Refer a Contact, and Customer Testimonials**

BTL may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on BTL Websites. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. BTL is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.

Customers and Visitors may elect to use BTL’s referral program to inform contacts about BTL Websites and Services. When using the referral program, you must have an existing business relationship, existing non-business relationship, personal relationship or family relationship (as understood by Canadian law) with both BTL and the person being contacted.  If those conditions are met,  BTL requests the contact’s name and email address.  BTL will automatically send the contact a one–time email inviting him or her to visit BTL Websites, and inform the person being contacted that you made the referral.

BTL posts a list of Customers and testimonials on BTL Websites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. BTL obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.

6. **Disclosure and Sharing of information Collected**

*BTL*

BTL may disclose your information in certain circumstances, namely when you have consented to the disclosure, to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected, when the services we are providing to you require us to give information to third parties, or when we are required or permitted by applicable law to do so.

*Service Providers*

BTL may share information about BTL Visitors, Customers and Attendees with BTL’s contracted service providers so that these service providers can provide services on our behalf. These service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide the requested services to us.  Without limiting the foregoing, BTL may also share information about BTL Visitors, Customers and Attendees with BTL’s service providers to ensure the quality of information provided. Unless described in this Privacy Policy, BTL does not share, sell, rent, or trade any information with third parties for their promotional purposes.

*Business Partners*

From time to time, BTL may partner with other companies to jointly offer products, services, or programs (such as webinars or downloadable content). If you purchase, specifically express interest in, or register for a jointly–offered product, service, or program from or through BTL, BTL may share information about BTL Customers collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our partner(s). BTL does not control our business partners’ use of the information about BTL Customers that we collect, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.

BTL does not share information about BTL Attendees with business partners unless: (1) you specifically opt in to such sharing via an event registration form; or (2) you attend a BTL event and allow BTL or any of its business partners to scan your attendee badge. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may choose not to opt in via event registration forms and elect not to have your badge scanned at BTL events.  If you choose to share your information with business partners in the manners described above, your information will be subject to the business partners’ respective privacy policies.

*Third Parties*

Section 4 of this Privacy Policy, Website Navigational Information, specifically addresses the information we or third parties collect through cookies, and how you can control cookies through your Web browsers.  We may also disclose your personal information to any third party with your prior consent.

*As Part of a Business Transfer*

Your information may be transferred to successor organization if, for example, we transfer the ownership or operation of the Services or BTL Websites to another organization if we merge with or are acquired by another organization, or if we liquidate our assets, and it may be disclosed as part of due diligence for any proposed transaction of this sort.

*Compelled Disclosure*

BTL reserves the right to use or disclose information provided if required by applicable law or if BTL reasonably believes that use or disclosure is necessary to protect BTL’s rights and/or to comply with any applicable law, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.

7. **International Transfer of Information Collected**

BTL is a Canadian company whose servers may be located worldwide. To facilitate BTL’s global operations, BTL may transfer and access such information to and from around the world, including from other countries in which BTL has operations. This Privacy Policy shall apply even if BTL transfers information about Visitors, Customers or Attendees to other countries.

Some or all of the information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located outside your jurisdiction of residence, including in the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the information.

8. **Consent**

By giving your information to us and by using our BTL Websites or Services, you voluntarily consent to the collection, use and disclosure of information as specified in this Privacy Policy.  Without limiting the foregoing, in addition we may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use, or disclose your information in specific circumstances, in which case we may ask for your consent in writing although in some circumstances we may accept your oral consent.  Sometimes your consent will be implied through your conduct with us if the purpose of the collection, use or disclosure is obvious and you voluntarily provide the information.  We may also collect, use and disclose information without your consent when we are required or permitted by applicable law to do so.

9. **Communications Preferences**

BTL offers Visitors, Customers, and Attendees who provide contact information a means to choose how BTL uses the information provided. You may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of BTL’s marketing emails.

10. **Correcting and Updating Your Information**

BTL may retain your information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection and as required or permitted by applicable law. For instance, we may retain your information during the time in which you have an account to use BTL Websites or Services and for a reasonable period of time afterward. We also may retain your information during the period of time needed for BTL to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

You may request to review, correct, delete or otherwise modify any of the personal information that you have previously provided to us through BTL Websites and Services.  If you have registered for an account with BTL, you may generally update your user settings, profile, organization’s settings or event registration by signing in into the applicable Website or Service and editing your settings or profile. To discontinue your account, and/or request return or deletion of Your information associated with your account, please contact your account representative or the customer service team for the applicable Service. Requests to access, change, or delete your information will be addressed within a reasonable timeframe, except where not required or is prohibited by applicable law. If you are an employee of a BTL customer, you may also wish to contact your company’s system administrator for assistance in correcting or updating your information.

11. **Customer Data**

BTL’s Customers may electronically submit data or information to the Services for hosting and processing purposes (“**Customer Data**”). BTL will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in our agreement for Services with the Customer (“**Customer Agreement**”) or as may be required or permitted by applicable law. In accordance with a Customer Agreement, BTL may access Customer Data only for the purpose of providing the Services or preventing or addressing service or technical problems or as may be required or permitted by applicable law.

BTL acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information.  If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to our Services by a BTL Customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend, or delete such data, please inquire with our Customer directly. Because BTL personnel have limited ability to access data our Customers submit to our Services, if you wish to make your request directly to BTL, please provide the name of the BTL Customer who submitted your data to our Services.  We will refer your request to that Customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

12. **Security**

The security of your information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means including maintaining reasonable physical, organizational and technological safeguards intended to help protect against unauthorized use, disclosure or access, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Information may only be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law.

We cannot guarantee the confidentiality or security of any e-mail communications or information sent by you to us via BTL Websites or Services.  If you wish to send us confidential information, please notify us first to make arrangements.
