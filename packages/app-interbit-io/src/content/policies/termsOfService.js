  1.1	The following are terms of a legal agreement between you, the user or viewer of the Interbit Platform (“**you**”, “**your**”, or “**User**”), and BTL Group Ltd. (“**BTL**”, “**we**”), the owner of this Interbit Platform.

  1.2	By accessing, browsing and/or using the Interbit Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to abide by and comply with all terms, conditions and notices contained in or referenced by the terms and conditions of use set out on these pages (“Terms”).  BTL reserves the right, in its discretion, to change these Terms and to post such changed Terms on the Interbit Platform without notice.  You further agree that these Terms constitute a binding contract between you and BTL and explain BTL’s obligations to you and your obligations when you access and use the Interbit Platform and the materials and information thereon.  If you do not agree to the terms AND CONDITIONS of these Terms, do not access or otherwise use the Interbit Platform.

  1.3	You shall be solely responsible for checking these Terms periodically for changes.  Your continued use of the Interbit Platform following the posting of any changes to these Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes.

  1.4	The Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement (“**Other Agreement**”) you may have with BTL for other BTL services or products.  Similarly, that Other Agreement shall not apply to the Interbit Platform, and the Interbit Platform shall not be considered a service or product or part of any service or product under such Other Agreement, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by BTL. The Interbit Platform is delivered from an infrastructure different from the infrastructure underlying other BTL services or products, and any representations or commitments by BTL regarding the security or availability of its services or products do not apply to Interbit Platform.

  1.5	You agree that your use of the Interbit Platform is not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by BTL regarding future functionality or features.

  1.6	As the Interbit Platform may be accessed globally, the jurisdiction (location) you choose to access the Interbit Platform is on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable local use controls, laws and regulations relating to the location you use to access the Interbit Platform, including those relating to the transmission of technical data exported or imported to or from the country in which you reside.  You may not access the Interbit Platform from any jurisdiction where it is legally prohibited.

  2.4	Your account may have “hard” and “soft” usage limits. The Interbit Platform may restrict you to the hard usage limits. BTL reserves the right to enforce soft usage limits in its sole discretion, which may result in BTL serving a “quota exceeded” page to you or users to whom you serve web pages via the Interbit Platform (“End Users”). Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of your account.

  2.5	You may use the Interbit Platform only to develop and run User Applications on the Interbit Platform infrastructure. You may not access the Interbit Platform for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against BTL or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Interbit Platform.

  15. **Third Party Websites and Resources**

  16. **Non-GA Services**

  From time to time BTL may invite you to try, at no charge, BTL products or services that are not generally available to BTL customers (“Non-GA Services”).

Non-GA Services are not considered “Interbit Platform” hereunder and are provided “AS IS” with no express or implied representation, warranty, or condition. BTL may discontinue Non-GA Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available.

  17. **Miscellaneous**

  17.1 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and BTL and govern your use of the Interbit Platform (but excluding any services which BTL may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and BTL in relation to the Interbit Platform. No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of thee Terms shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the modification, amendment or waiver is to be asserted.

  17.2 The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership or joint venture.

  17.3 If BTL provides you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the English language version of these Terms will control if there is any conflict.

  17.4 You agree that BTL may provide you with notices by email, regular mail, or postings on the Interbit Platform. By providing BTL your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.

  17.5 You agree that if BTL does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in these Terms (or which BTL has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of BTL ‘s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to BTL.

  17.6 The Terms, and your relationship with BTL under these Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict of laws principles that would apply a different body of law. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed.  You and BTL agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of British Columbia and the venue of the courts of British Columbia sitting in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia to resolve any legal matter arising from these Terms; except that either party will have the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable harm.

  17.7 Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign the entirety of its rights and obligations under these Terms, without consent of the other party, to its affiliate or to its successor in interest by way of merger, combination (by any means, including by plan of arrangement), acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, provided that the assignee must concurrently agree in writing to assume all obligations and covenants of the assignor and to be bound by the terms of these Terms.  Any attempt by either Party to assign any of the rights or obligations of these Terms except as permitted by these Terms is void.

  17.8 These Terms and any agreement and document referred to herein shall extend to and be binding upon BTL and the User and enure to the benefit of the Released Parties and the User and, as applicable, their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors and legal representatives.
